This folder will contain sample code dealing with [HuggingFace Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/index)

ðŸ¤— PEFT, or Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), is a library for efficiently adapting pre-trained language models (PLMs) to various downstream applications without fine-tuning all the modelâ€™s parameters. PEFT methods only fine-tune a small number of (extra) model parameters, significantly decreasing computational and storage costs because fine-tuning large-scale PLMs is prohibitively costly. Recent state-of-the-art PEFT techniques achieve performance comparable to that of full fine-tuning.
