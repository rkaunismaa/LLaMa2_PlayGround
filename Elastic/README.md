Revisiting this work because I want to get back to the Match Image search stuff. 

Match_Image_Search.ipynb

And off the top of my head, I don't remember which docker container or conda environment I need to run this in!!! 

OK ... so it looks like we run this stuff in the 'hfpt_Dec14' docker container. And of course, the 'elasticsearch' and 'kibana' containers are running in the background ...
