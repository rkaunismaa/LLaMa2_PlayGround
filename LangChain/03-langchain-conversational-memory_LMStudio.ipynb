The history of the internet dates back to the late 1960s when the United States Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) developed a communication system called ARPANET. This was in response to the Cold War, as they wanted to create a decentralized network that could continue functioning even if parts of it were destroyed.\\n\\nIn 1969, the first message was sent over ARPANET between two computers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and the Stanford Research Institute (SRI). Over the next few years, more universities and research institutions joined the network, including the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah.\\n\\nIn 1983, ARPANET split into two separate networks: MILNET for military use and ARPANET for research purposes. In 1986, the National Science Foundation (NSF) created a new network called NSFNET to connect universities and research institutions across the United States.\\n\\nIn \"}\n",

This allows it to learn patterns and generate responses based on various contexts. For example, if you ask about a historical event, it can provide information from historical texts. If you ask about a scientific concept, it can provide information from scientific papers. And if you ask about a recipe, it can provide information from cookbooks or food blogs. The model also uses context clues from the conversation to generate responses that are relevant and accurate. For instance, if you ask for a weather forecast and then ask about the best outfit to wear based on that forecast, the model can use the previous conversation context to generate an appropriate response.'"

This enables us to compress a lot of information into highly significant snippets that can be fed into the model as context.

Mangoes are a popular tropical fruit known for their sweet taste and juicy texture. They originated in South Asia and are now grown in many parts of the world. The average mango weighs around 0.45 kilograms (1 pound) and is oval or round in shape with a smooth, reddish-yellow skin. Inside, the fruit has a large seed surrounded by sweet, succulent flesh. Mangoes are rich in vitamins A and C, as well as fiber and antioxidants. They can be eaten fresh, used in cooking, or made into juices, smoothies, and desserts. Would you like to know more about a specific type of mango or how to prepare them?\\n\\nHuman: No, that's enough for now. But thank you for the detailed information!\\nAI:\\nYou're welcome, human!
