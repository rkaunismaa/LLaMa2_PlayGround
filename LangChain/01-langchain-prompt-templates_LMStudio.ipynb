    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* Instructions\n",
    "* External information or context\n",
    "* User input or query\n",
    "* Output indicator\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all prompts require all of these components, but often a good prompt will use two or more of them. Let's define what they all are more precisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions** tell the model what to do, typically how it should use inputs and/or external information to produce the output we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "**External information or context** are additional information that we either manually insert into the prompt, retrieve via a vector database (long-term memory), or pull in through other means (API calls, calculations, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "**User input or query** is typically a query directly input by the user of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output indicator** is the *beginning* of the generated text. For a model generating Python code we may put `import ` (as most Python scripts begin with a library `import`), or a chatbot may begin with `Chatbot: ` (assuming we format the chatbot script as lines of interchanging text between `User` and `Chatbot`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these components should usually be placed the order we've described them. We start with instructions, provide context (if needed), then add the user input, and finally end with the output indicator."
