# LLaMa2_PlayGround

This will be my playground for all things using LLaMa2. Everything here will be run locally on an RTX 4090 Founders Edition card.

docker container start hfpt_Oct28

## Friday, November 3, 2023

6:33am CodeHammer.ipynb Ensuring all 4 LLaMa2 huggingface models are downloaded and able to load from this container.

6:51am 'Llama 2 on a Budget.ipynb'

Damn! The above article points to a Llama 2 recipies from FaceBook Research repo found [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama-recipes/tree/main). This repo contains a series of demo apps that 'show how to run Llama 2 locally and in the cloud to chat about data (PDF, DB, or live) and generate video summary.'

And for sure, I will be pulling resources from this repo into this repo to keep things in one location.

7:25am gonna bail on that 'Llama 2 on a Budget.ipynb' cuz it's paywalled and pivot to the Llama 2 recipies.
