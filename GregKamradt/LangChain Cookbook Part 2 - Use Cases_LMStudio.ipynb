    "### **What is LangChain?**\n",
    "> LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.\n",
    "*[Source](https://blog.langchain.dev/announcing-our-10m-seed-round-led-by-benchmark/#:~:text=LangChain%20is%20a%20framework%20for%20developing%20applications%20powered%20by%20language%20models)*\n",
    "\n",
    "**TLDR**: LangChain makes the complicated parts of working & building with AI models easier. It helps do this in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integration** - Bring external data, such as your files, other applications, and api data, to your LLMs\n",
    "2. **Agency** - Allow your LLMs to interact with its environment via decision making. Use LLMs to help decide which action to take next\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why LangChain?**\n",
    "1. **Components** - LangChain makes it easy to swap out abstractions and components necessary to work with language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Customized Chains** - LangChain provides out of the box support for using and customizing 'chains' - a series of actions strung together.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Speed 🚢** - This team ships insanely fast. You'll be up to date with the latest LLM features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Community 👥** - Wonderful [discord](https://discord.gg/6adMQxSpJS) and community support, meet ups, hackathons, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though LLMs can be straightforward (text-in, text-out) you'll quickly run into friction points that LangChain helps with once you develop more complicated applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Main Use Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Summarization** - Express the most important facts about a body of text or chat interaction\n",
    "* **Question and Answering Over Documents** - Use information held within documents to answer questions or query\n",
    "* **Extraction** - Pull structured data from a body of text or an user query\n",
    "* **Evaluation** - Understand the quality of output from your application\n",
    "* **Querying Tabular Data** - Pull data from databases or other tabular source\n",
    "* **Code Understanding** - Reason about and digest code\n",
    "* **Interacting with APIs** - Query APIs and interact with the outside world\n",
    "* **Chatbots** - A framework to have a back and forth interaction with a user combined with memory in a chat interface\n",
    "* **Agents** - Use LLMs to make decisions about what to do next. Enable these decisions with tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Want to see live examples of these use cases? Head over to the [LangChain Project Gallery](https://github.com/gkamradt/langchain-tutorials)\n",

    "* You'll notice I repeat import statements throughout the notebook. My intention is to lean on the side of clarity and help you see the full code block in one spot. No need to go back and forth to see when we imported a package.\n",
    "* We use the default models throughout the notebook, at the time of writing they were davinci-003 and gpt-3.5-turbo. You would no doubt get better results with GPT4\n",

      "have so many choices.  There are just two or three of you, and a\n",
      "thousand things you could do. How do you decide?Here's the answer: Do whatever's best for your users.  You can hold\n",

      "convince investors to give you money.  If you're a good salesman,\n",
      "you could try to just talk them into it.  But the more reliable\n",
      "route is to convince them through your users: if you make something\n",
      "users love enough to tell their friends, you grow exponentially,\n",
      "and that will convince any investor.Being good is a particularly useful strategy for making decisions\n",
      "in complex situations because it's stateless.  It's like telling\n",
      "the truth.  The trouble with lying is that you have to remember\n",
      "everything you've said in the past to make sure you don't contradict\n",
      "yourself.  If you tell the truth you don't have to remember anything,\n",
      "and that's a really useful property in domains where things happen\n",
      "fast.For example, Y Combinator has now invested in 80 startups, 57 of\n",
      "which are still alive.  (The rest have died or merged or been\n",
      "acquired.)  When you're trying to advise 57 startups, it turns out\n",
      "you have to have a stateless algorithm.  You can't have ulterior\n",
      "motives when you have 57 things going on at once, because you can't\n",
      "remember them.  So our rule is just to do whatever's best for the\n",
      "founders.  Not because we're particularly benevolent, but because\n",
