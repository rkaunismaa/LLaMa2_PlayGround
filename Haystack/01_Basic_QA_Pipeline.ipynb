The music consultant for HBO and music supervisor of ''Game of Thrones'' Evyen Klean then suggested Ramin Djawadi to David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. Djawadi, although initially interested, declined the offer three days later as the schedule conflicted with a film project he was working on.  However, after a few meetings, Djawadi was persuaded to take on the project. The showrunners Benioff and Weiss sent Djawadi the first two episodes of the series, which impressed Djawadi. He arranged a meeting with Benioff and Weiss to discuss the concept of the series, after which he began to compose the music for the series.\\n\\nAccording to Djawadi, Benioff and Weiss were interested in using music to support the different characters and plots.  They wanted the music to express the emotion and mood of each scene in the series, and that distinct themes should be created for the main characters. \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 1}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '12f9a249200a1a1f9495f2acd432fd77'}>,\n",

Once the filming is nearly completed, episodes are sent to Djawadi either singly or in batches of multiple episodes as they were being edited together but often before any special effects added to the footage.  Benioff and Weiss would also inform Djawadi in advance of the need to expand a theme or create new themes for characters. Djawadi wrote all the music in Santa Monica, California. Asked in interview about the overall process of composing the music and how it is used in the series, Djawadi said: \"I sit with David and Dan and we do what\\'s called a spotting session where we watch the entire episode and then discuss when music should start and stop.

Djawadi said he intended to capture the overall impression of the series with the theme tune.

The theme for House Stark is the first theme to be composed and is played on a cello. Most of the Stark characters only have variations on the same theme on cello.

House Lannister has an associated song, \"The Rains of Castamere\", which became their theme.  The song was played at the Red Wedding, but first heard when Tyrion Lannister whistled a small part in the first episode of the second season.  When a theme has become established, different versions that are darker or lighter are then introduced, and concepts such as honor and conspiracy are also represented in themes.\\n\\nDjawadi chose distinctive sounds and instruments for different leitmotifs and themes, for example, didgeridoos are used for the wildlings, while the Armenian duduk flute is used for the Dothrakis.

The theme music for the White Walker extended over time into the music of the Army of the Dead, representing the gathering strength of Army of the Dead, which was only introduced in full in the finale of the seventh season when the Wall fell.\\n\\nThe themes may evolve over time in the series.  The theme for Daenerys Targaryen started small, but became grander as she became more powerful. Her theme was initially played with a single instrument such as a processed cello, but later began incorporating more instruments, including Japanese taiko-inspired drums, Indonesian bedug drums, and an Armenian duduk flute.

In a 2012 study, out of 40 recent television drama shows, \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' ranked second in deaths per episode, averaging 14 deaths.\\n\\n===Themes===\\n\\nThe series is generally praised for what is perceived as a sort of medieval realism. George R.R. Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre.

Just like people\\'s capacity for good and for evil in real life, Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change. The series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective, unlike in many other fantasies, and thus the supposed villains can provide their side of the story. Benioff said, \"George brought a measure of harsh realism to high fantasy. He introduced gray tones into a black-and-white universe.\"In early seasons, under the influence of the \\'\\'A Song of Ice and Fire\\'\\' books, main characters were regularly killed off, and this was credited with developing tension among viewers. In later seasons, critics pointed out that certain characters had developed \"plot armor\" to survive in unlikely circumstances, and attributed this to \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' deviating from the novels to become more of a traditional television series.

Most of Westeros is reminiscent of high medieval Europe, from lands and cultures, to the palace intrigue, feudal system, castles, and knightly tournaments. A principal inspiration for the novels is the English Wars of the Roses (1455–1485) between the houses of Lancaster and York, reflected in Martin\\'s houses of Lannister and Stark. The scheming Cersei Lannister evokes Isabella, the \"she-wolf of France\" (1295–1358).

The success of the show led to a number of fantasy series being commissioned on television, including a retelling of the \\'\\'Lord of the Rings\\'\\' by Amazon Studios. According to Neil Gaiman, whose works \\'\\'Good Omens\\'\\' and \\'\\'American Gods\\'\\' were adapted for TV, \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' did help change attitudes towards fantasy on television, but mainly it made big budgets for fantasy series more acceptable. The success of the genre had been attributed by writers to a longing for escapism in popular culture, frequent female nudity and a skill in balancing lighthearted and serious topics (dragons and politics, for example) which provided it with a prestige enjoyed by conventional, top-tier drama series.\\n\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 36}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '6995dab15ad7abbba16630c6ffeababf'}>,\n",

A first season scene in which Petyr Baelish explains his motives (or background) while prostitutes have sex in the background gave rise to the word \"sexposition\" for providing exposition with sex and nudity. \"Dothraki\", the series\\' nomadic horsemen, was ranked fourth in a September 2012 Global Language Monitor list of words from television most used on the Internet. In 2012, the media used \"Game of Thrones\" as a figure of speech or comparison for situations of intense conflict and deceit, such as US healthcare politics, the Syrian Civil War and the ousting of Bo Xilai from the Chinese government.\\n\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 37}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '42eca3726f03b91888a401486cb90e75'}>,\n",

Having to fill so many speaking roles, the showrunners not only \"postponed\" the introduction of several key characters, but they also merged some into one, or certain plot-functions were given to different characters.
