At the beginning checking the attendance, asking them to give me the date in the foreing language so I can put it down in the register.

I don't want them to do the exercices only, cause it's too automatic.\\r\\nAlex: sounds really cool...you are so experienced...I wish I was too :/\\r\\nElizabeth: calm down, you'll just learn everything with practice. If you don't want to make your lessons too formal, you can look for some games. I recommend Kaboom.\\r\\nAlex: Kaboom? I don't know this game\\r\\nElizabeth: you just write the words on little pieces of paper, for example names of fruit or vegetables and put it all in a little bag. Every person takes out a single piece of paper and has to translate a word written on it. If they spot the answer, they keep it, if they don't, the card goes back to the bag.\\r\\nAlex: Sounds really cool! I'm sure I'll try it.
